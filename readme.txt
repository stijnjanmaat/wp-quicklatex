Allows user to embed LaTeX math into posts with proper positioning so that formulas and surrounding text blend together well.

== Description ==

Allows user to insert mathematical formulas in the posts and comments using LaTeX language.
Usual LaTeX plugins suffer from incorrect formula positioning relative to surrounding text producing "jumpy" equations painful for eyes and decreasing overall readability of the web article. 
WP QuickLaTeX is the only one plugin which solves this issue. 

Just wrap LaTeX code with [tex][/tex] or [latex][/latex] or [math][/math] tags. 
WP QuickLaTeX will convert it to high-quality image and embed into post with proper positioning so that formula and surrounding text will blend together well.
WP QuickLaTeX is based on free web service [QuickLaTeX.com](http://quicklatex.com/) and doesn't require 
LaTeX to be installed on user's server or hosting account.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add LaTeX to my posts? =

Wrap LaTeX code with [tex][/tex] or [latex][/latex] or [math][/math] tags.
Alternatively less-than '<' and greater-than '>' signs can be used instead of square brackets in the tags.

= How can I send bug reports or request new feature? =

Please use comments on the plugin's web page [WP-QuickLaTeX](http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/?page_id=1422).
I'll do my best to help you.

= Why there is no option to specify background color for formula image? =

There is a problem of matching background color of the page and formula image.
Some LaTeX plugins solves this task by pushing user to set up formula background color manually. 
I find this inappropriate.

Using WP QuickLaTeX bloggers don’t need to worry about this low-level issue anymore. 
Images generated by the plugin are transparent which means they fit well with any background (color/texture/etc.)
used on the page. No additional actions required from the user – problem being solved automatically.
