Allows user to embed LaTeX math into posts with proper positioning so that formulas and surrounding text blend together well.

== Description ==

Allows user to insert mathematical formulas in the posts and comments using LaTeX. 
Besides basic functionality WP-QuickLaTeX has unique features:

1.	Proper formula positioning so it blends well with surrounding text. Say “NO” to jumpy equations produced by other plugins!
1.	Meaningful error messages for mistakes in LaTeX code (see screenshot).

Just wrap LaTeX code with [tex][/tex] or [latex][/latex] or [math][/math] or $$..$$ tags. 
WP QuickLaTeX will convert it to high-quality image and embed into post properly.
WP QuickLaTeX is based on free web service [QuickLaTeX.com](http://quicklatex.com/) and doesn't require LaTeX to be installed on user's server or hosting account.

== Screenshots ==

1. Example of error message caused by mistake in LaTeX code. In this case `\sqrt` command was misspelled.

== Installation ==

WP QuickLaTeX is based on free web service [QuickLaTeX.com](http://quicklatex.com/) and doesn't require 
LaTeX to be installed on user's server or hosting account. Just install the plugin and you are good to go.

1. Download WP-QuickLaTeX plug-in.
2. Unzip the plugin file and upload its content to `wp-content/plugins` folder of your blog.
3. Activate WP-QuickLaTeX through the 'Plugins' menu in Wordpress.

If you want maximum performance you might create `ql-cache` folder in `wp-content`. 
It will be used by WP-QuickLaTeX for caching necessary data to decrease loading time of your pages. 
Just make sure `ql-cache` is writable (by `chmod 777` or through File Manager in cPanel).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add LaTeX to my posts? =

Wrap LaTeX code with [tex][/tex] or [latex][/latex] or [math][/math] or $$..$$ tags.

= How can I send bug reports or request new feature? =

Please use comments on the plugin's web page [WP-QuickLaTeX](http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/?page_id=1422).
I'll do my best to help you.

= Why there is no option to specify background color for formula image? =

There is a problem of matching background color of the page and formula image.
Some LaTeX plugins solves this task by pushing user to set up formula background color manually. 
I find this inappropriate.

Using WP QuickLaTeX bloggers don’t need to worry about this low-level issue anymore. 
Images generated by the plugin are transparent which means they fit well with any background (color/texture/etc.)
used on the page. No additional actions required from the user – problem being solved automatically.
